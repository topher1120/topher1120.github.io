I recently started learning and using Rust. For my first real project, I wanted to build a tool for sending and receiving some AWS SQS messages. Amazon recently announced support for Rust through an official SDK, but at the time of this writing it is in early alpha stages and only supports a select set of services, none of which I&amp;rsquo;m familiar. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see the support from Amazon and look forward to using it in the future, but I want to use AWS now.</description></item></channel></rss>
